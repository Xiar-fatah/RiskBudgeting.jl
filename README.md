RiskBudgeting.jl is a Julia package for calculating the weights of the risk budgeting portfolio with inspiration from the paper Robust Risk Budgeting Algorithms in R by Farah Bouzida. RiskBudgeting.jl consists of two steps, the risk partition of the portfolio assets and the solvers for the optimization of the risk partition. For usage, please see the [documention](https://xiar-fatah.github.io/RiskBudgeting.jl/stable/).
